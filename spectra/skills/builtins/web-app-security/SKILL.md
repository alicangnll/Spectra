Task: Web Application Security Analysis. You are analyzing web applications for security vulnerabilities following OWASP Top 10 and modern security practices.

## Approach

Systematic analysis covering authentication, authorization, input validation, business logic, and modern web framework issues. Focus on both client-side and server-side vulnerabilities.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Analyzing web applications for security vulnerabilities
- Reviewing web application code for security issues
- Testing authentication, authorization, and session management
- Analyzing API security and data validation
- Assessing input validation and output encoding
- Testing for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Reviewing JavaScript client-side security
- Analyzing web framework-specific issues

## Workflow

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Map application structure and endpoints
   - Identify technologies and frameworks
   - Discover hidden endpoints and admin panels
   - Analyze JavaScript bundles and dependencies

2. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test login flows and password reset
   - Analyze session management and cookies
   - Test for session fixation and hijacking
   - Evaluate 2FA and SSO implementations

3. **Authorization Testing**
   - Test for IDOR and access control bypasses
   - Analyze role-based access control
   - Test for privilege escalation
   - Evaluate API authorization

4. **Input Validation Testing**
   - Test for injection vulnerabilities
   - Analyze input sanitization and validation
   - Test for XSS and CSRF
   - Evaluate file upload security

5. **Business Logic Testing**
   - Test for workflow bypasses
   - Analyze rate limiting and throttling
   - Test for race conditions and TOCTOU
   - Evaluate payment and transaction flows

## OWASP Top 10 Categories

**A01: Broken Access Control**
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)

- Missing authorization on sensitive endpoints
- Admin panel exposure

**A02: Cryptographic Failures**
- Sensitive data in transit (no HTTPS)
- Weak encryption algorithms
- Hardcoded keys and passwords
- Missing security headers

**A03: Injection**
- SQL Injection (union, blind, time-based)
- NoSQL Injection (MongoDB, Redis)
- Command Injection
- LDAP Injection

**A04: Insecure Design**
- Missing security controls
- Unsafe default configurations
- Insecure workflows

**A05: Security Misconfiguration**
- Default credentials
- Exposed admin panels
- Verbose error messages
- Missing security headers

**A06: Vulnerable Components**
- Outdated libraries with known CVEs
- Unpatched dependencies
- Unused but vulnerable components

**A07: Authentication Failures**
- Weak password policies
- Session fixation
- Credential stuffing
- Missing 2FA

**A08: Software/Data Integrity Failures**
- Insecure updates
- Unsigned firmware/software
- CI/CD pipeline vulnerabilities

**A09: Logging/Monitoring Failures**
- Insufficient logging
- Missing audit trails
- No alerting on critical events

**A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
- Internal port scanning
- Cloud metadata access
- Internal API calls

- Missing token expiration

**Access Control:**
- IDOR vulnerabilities
- Missing authorization checks
